# chrome-extension-mirror

This extension shall once be able to mirror to sites
which means that you have two tabs and the user-actions performed in the one tab are mirrored in the other tab.
currently I just need it to ensure that different websites work in the same, but maybe it's useful in other cases.

So go ahead and make it work!!! :-)

1. checkout this repo
2. open chrome 
3. navigate to **chrome://extensions**
4. turn on **developer mode**
5. press **load unpacked extensions**
6. choose the projects folder
